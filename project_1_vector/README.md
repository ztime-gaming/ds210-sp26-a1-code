# Mini Project 1: Build your own vector!

This mini project consists of two parts:
1. Part 1 - due February 23
2. Part 2 - due March 2

This mini project contains the following folders:
1. `slow_vec`: the stencil for **part 1**:
   - `slow_vec/src/lib.rs` this is where you will put **your solution for part 1**.
   - `slow_vec/tests/` our auto grader tests, if you pass these, you will get full credit.
   - `slow_vec/src/main.rs` and `slow_vec/src/memory.rs` contain helpful code for you to play around with to get familiar with the task at hand.
2. `fixed`: contains the `FixedSizeArray` type that you will use for part 1. You do not need to modify anything here. Feel free to skim the code if you are curious about how it works after finishing part 1.
3. `fast_vec`: the stencil for **part 2**.
4. `malloc`: contains the memory allocator you will use for part 2. You do not need to modify or read this code.
5. `tracker`: contains a helpful tool for debugging/tracking data in memory.

The mini project handout on the course website explain to you what you need to do and how you use these folders.
